# E-commerce Web Scraper 
Built a stealthy web crawler using Selenium and undetected-chromedriver to bypass anti-bot measures on e-commerce sites. Simulated human behavior by randomizing headers, managing DOM timing, and bypassing automation flags. Implemented strategic delays, custom fingerprinting, and robust error handling to avoid detection and ensure reliable scraping.
